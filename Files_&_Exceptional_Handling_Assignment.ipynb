        "1. What is the difference between interpreted and compiled languages?\n",
        " - In interpreted languages code is executed directly without a seperate compilation step to convert into machine code, but in compiled languages the code is acctually taken in a compiler then code is transformed into machine code by compiler.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. What is exception handling in Python?\n",
        "  - Exception handling in Python is a way to deal with errors that occur when a program is running. It helps to make code more robust and user-friendly.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. What is the purpose of the finally block in exception handling?\n",
        " - In the time of excecution the code is enter in except block or doesn't enter in except block it doesn't matter, the print statement in finally block will be always print.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. What is logging in Python?\n",
        " - It records the state and flow of the code. It is useful to understanding, monitoring and debugging of code. It shows how the code behaves over time.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. What is the significance of the __del__ method in Python?\n",
        " - The __del__ method is used to release any resources held by an object when that object is deleted.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. What is the difference between import and from ... import in Python?\n",
        " - Generally, we use the import statement when we need to use many attributes from a module, or when the module name is short and easy to remember, but when we only need to use a few attributes from a module, or when the module name is long and hard to remember, we use from statement.\n",
        "\n",
        "7. How can you handle multiple exceptions in Python?\n",
        " - In Python, you can handle multiple exceptions in several ways. Here are some common methods to handle multiple exceptions like, Multiple except block, using a try block.\n",
        "\n",
        "8. What is the purpose of the with statement when handling files in Python?\n",
        " - In handling files, the purpose of the with statement is to ensure that resources are properly managed, particularly for closing files automatically, even if an exception occurs during the operation.\n",
        "\n",
        "9. What is the difference between multithreading and multiprocessing?\n",
        " - In multithreading it happens on one proccesor, threads share same memory space and resouirses within a process but in multiprocessing there are multiple cores/processors, each process has its own memory space and resources which are isolated from other process.\n",
        "\n",
        "10. What are the advantages of using logging in a program?\n",
        " - The advantages of using logging in a program is debugging, monitoring, and understanding application behavior by providing a record of events.\n",
        "\n",
        "11. What is memory management in Python?\n",
        " - Memory management in python is the process of allocating and dealing with memory so that the programs can run efficiently.\n",
        "\n",
        "12. What are the basic steps involved in exception handling in Python?\n",
        " - The basic steps involved in exception handling in python are try, except, else, finally.\n",
        "\n",
        "13. Why is memory management important in Python?\n",
        " - Memory management is important in Python, to understanding how it works can help you write more efficient, scalable, and reliable code.\n",
        "\n",
        "14. What is the role of try and except in exception handling?\n",
        " - In exception handling, the try block contains code that might potentially raise an exception, while the except block handles the exception if one occurs, allowing the program to continue running instead of crashing.\n",
        "\n",
        "15. How does Python's garbage collection system work?\n",
        " - Python's garbage collection system is used to automatically manage memory by reclaiming memory that is no longer in use, helping to avoid memory leaks and optimize the performance.\n",
        "\n",
        "16. What is the purpose of the else block in exception handling?\n",
        " - The else block in Python's exception handling is used to define code that should run only if no exception was raised in the try block.\n",
        "\n",
        "17. What are the common logging levels in Python?\n",
        " -\n",
        "\n",
        "18. What is the difference between os.fork() and multiprocessing in Python?\n",
        " -\n",
        "\n",
        "19. What is the importance of closing a file in Python?\n",
        " - Closing a file is a crucial part of file management in programming, as it ensures the release of system resources, data integrity, and prevents data corruption. It is essential to close files after using them to maintain the stability and reliability of any application that involves file handling.\n",
        "\n",
        "20. What is the difference between file.read() and file.readline() in Python?\n",
        " - In Python, the file.read() method is used to read a specified number of characters from a file or input stream, while the file.readline() method is used to read a single line from a file.\n",
        "\n",
        "21. What is the logging module in Python used for?\n",
        " - The logging module in Python is used for tracking events that happen during the execution of a program.\n",
        "\n",
        "22. What is the os module in Python used for in file handling?\n",
        " - In file handling, the os module is commonly used to perform operations such as file and directory manipulation, checking file existence, and getting file properties.\n",
        "\n",
        "23. What are the challenges associated with memory management in Python?\n",
        " - Memory management in Python comes with a few challenges like language handles objects, garbage collection, and memory allocation.\n",
        "\n",
        "24.  How do you raise an exception manually in Python?\n",
        " - In Python, we can raise an exception manually using the raise keyword. This allows to trigger an exception at any point in the code, either by raising a predefined exception or by defining a custom exception.\n",
